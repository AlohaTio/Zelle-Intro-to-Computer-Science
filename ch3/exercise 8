#The Gregorian epact
#   This program finds the value of the Gregorian epact in days
#   when given the year
#
#   The Gregorian epact is the number of days between January 1st and the previous new moon.
#       This value is used to figure out the date of Easter. It is calculated
#       by these formulas (using int arithmetic): C = year/100
#       epact = (8+(C/4)-C+((8*C+13)/25)+11*(year%19))%30
#   Write a program that prompts the user for a 4-digit year and then outputs
#       the value of the epact
