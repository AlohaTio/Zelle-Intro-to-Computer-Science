#Write a program that approximates the value of pi by summing the terms of
#   this series: 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - 4/11+... The program
#   should prompt the user for n, the number of terms to sum, and then output the
#   sum of the first n terms of this series. Have your program subtract the
#   approximation from the value of math.pi to see how accurate it is.
