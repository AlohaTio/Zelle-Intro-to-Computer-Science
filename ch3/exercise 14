def main():

	print("This program will average a series of number that are entered by the user")
	print("The user will first input the number of numbers to be averaged")
	
#Prompt the user for the number of numbers to be summed up
	n = int(input("Please enter the number of numbers that you would like to add up: "))	
	
#Set up the loop and the accumulator
	total = 0.0
	for i in range(n):
		total = total + float(input("Enter a number : "))
	
#Calculate the average
