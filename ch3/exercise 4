#Chapter 3, Exercise 
#	This program is ment to determine the distance of a lightning strike based on
#	the difference between when it is seen and heard.
def main():
	#Describe the program to the user
	print("This program is ment to determine the distance of a lightning strike ")
	print("based on the time elapsed between the flash and the sound of thunder.")
	
	#Prompt the user for their input in seconds
	time = float(input("Please input the elapsed time in seconds: "))
	
	#Calculate the distance and convert the answer to distance in miles
	miles = time * 1100.0 / 5280.0

	#Return the result and format the float
	print("The lightning strike is aproxamitly", "%.2f" % round(miles, 2), "miles away.")
