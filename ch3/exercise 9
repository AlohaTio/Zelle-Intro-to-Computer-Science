#The Area of a Triangle
	#This is a program to compute the area of a triangle
	#when you are given the length of the three sides
	#s = (a+b+c)/2
	#A = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))

	print("This is a program to calculate the area of a triangle when n\you are given the length of the three sides")
	
	#prompt the user for the length of the three sides
	a = float(input("Please enter the length of side a: "))
	b = float(input("Please enter the length of side b: "))
	c = float(input("Please enter the length of side c: "))

	#Calculate s the calculate the area of the triangle
	s = (a + b + c) / 2
	A = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

	#Format and Return the Area of the triangle to the user	
	print("The area of the triangle is", "%.2f" % round(A, 2))
