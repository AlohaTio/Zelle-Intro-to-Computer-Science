#Python Programming Third Edition
#Chapter 3, Exercise 6
#	This program calculates the slope of a line when given two points
#	With the assumption that it is a NON-VERTICAL line.

def main():
	#Describe the program to the user
	print("This program calculates the slope of a NON-VERTICAL line")
	
	#Prompt the user for inputs in with simultaneous assignment
	x1, y1 = eval(input("Please input the coordinates of the first point in the form x1, y1: "))
	x2, y2 = eval(input("Please input the coordinates of the second point in the form x2, y2: "))
	#x1, y1, x2, y2 = float(x1), float(y1), float(x2), float(y2)
	
    #calculate the slope of the line
	slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
	
	#Return the slope of the line to the user
	print("The slope of your line is:", "%.2f" % round(slope, 2))
