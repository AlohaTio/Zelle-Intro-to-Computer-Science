# Exercise 5 Konditorei coffee shop 
#   This program calculates the cost of an order of coffee.
#   Price per pound plus shipping 
#
#   The Konditorei coffee shop sells coffee at $10.50 a pound plus the cost of
#       shipping. Each order ships for $0.86 per pound + $1.50 fixed cost for
#       overhead. Write a program that calculates the cost of an order.

def main():
    # Describe the program to the user
    print "This program calculates the cost of an order of coffee from Konditorei"
    print "The price per pound of coffee plus the shipping cost"
    print

    #Get our inputs, the number of pounds of coffee
    lbs = input("Enter the nuber of pounds of coffee in the order: ")

    #Compute the cost
    shipping = 1.5 + lbs * 0.86
    coffee = lbs * 10.5
    cost = coffee + shipping

    #print the results, round down to 2 decimel points
    print
    print "The cost of shipping is:       ", "$%.2f" % round(shipping, 2)
    print "The cost of your coffee is:    ", "$%.2f" % round(coffee, 2)
    print "The total cost of your order is", "$%.2f" % round(cost, 2)
